# Contributing to ZeroPress

Thank you for your interest in contributing to **ZeroPress**.

ZeroPress is currently in **alpha**. The project is under active design and architectural development, and many parts are intentionally evolving. At this stage, contributions are focused on **discussion, feedback, and direction-setting**, rather than large code changes.

---

## Current Project Stage (Alpha)

- APIs, data models, and internal architecture may change without notice
- Backward compatibility is **not guaranteed**
- Documentation and tooling are incomplete by design

Because of this, we are intentionally conservative about accepting code contributions.

---

## How You Can Contribute Right Now

### 1. Feedback & Discussion (Most Valuable)

We highly value:
- Architectural feedback
- Design critiques
- Use-case discussions
- Cloudflare-specific insights
- CMS and publishing workflow ideas

Please use:
- GitHub Issues (for ideas, questions, and feedback)
- GitHub Discussions (if enabled)

---

### 2. Bug Reports

If you encounter a bug:
- Clearly describe the expected vs actual behavior
- Include steps to reproduce
- Provide environment details (Cloudflare service, browser, etc.) if relevant

Even partial or suspected issues are welcome at this stage.

---

### 3. Documentation Improvements

Small improvements such as:
- Clarifying README text
- Fixing typos
- Improving explanations

are welcome and appreciated.

---

## Code Contributions

At the alpha stage:

- Large features and refactors are **not accepted** without prior discussion
- Pull requests may be closed if they do not align with the current roadmap
- Experimental or exploratory branches may be suggested instead

If you plan to submit code:
1. Open an Issue first to discuss the idea
2. Keep changes small and focused
3. Avoid breaking existing behavior unless explicitly discussed
