# ZeroPress Governance

This document describes how the ZeroPress project is governed during its current stage of development.

ZeroPress is an **alpha-stage project** and is currently maintained under a **benevolent maintainer model**.

---

## Project Authority

- The ZeroPress project is currently led and maintained by the **ZeroPress Project Team**.
- Final decisions regarding architecture, roadmap, releases, licensing, and branding rest with the project maintainer(s).
- Community feedback is strongly encouraged, but consensus is not required for decisions.

This model allows the project to move quickly while its core architecture is still evolving.

---

## Decision-Making Process

During the alpha phase:

- Major decisions may be made unilaterally by the maintainer(s)
- Design discussions may occur in GitHub Issues or Discussions
- Decisions may prioritize long-term vision over short-term compatibility

All significant changes should be documented publicly where possible.

---

## Contributions and Influence

- Anyone may propose ideas, report issues, or submit feedback
- Code contributions are reviewed at the discretion of the maintainer(s)
- Acceptance of a contribution does **not** grant decision-making authority

See **CONTRIBUTING.md** for details.

---

## Maintainers

At this stage, the list of maintainers is intentionally kept minimal.

- ZeroPress Project Team

Additional maintainers may be added as the project matures.

---

## Roadmap Transparency

The roadmap may change frequently during alpha.

- Published plans are indicative, not binding
- Features may be postponed, redesigned, or removed

---

## Governance Evolution

As ZeroPress moves toward beta and stable releases:

- Governance may evolve toward a more formal model
- Roles such as maintainers, reviewers, or steering groups may be introduced

Any governance changes will be documented in this file.
